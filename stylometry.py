Signal two: the style signal. ← YOU BUILD THIS IN MILESTONE 4

Signal one reads the text for meaning. This one measures it *as text* — the
shape of it, without understanding a word.

Three measures are stubbed below because the brief names those three. They are
stubs, not implementations: what they compute is yours, and so is how you
combine them.

    sentence_length_spread   do sentences vary in length, or march in step?
    type_token_ratio         how much of the vocabulary repeats?
    punctuation_density      how much punctuation, and how varied?

Why these might differ between human and AI writing: generated prose tends
toward even, mid-length sentences and a narrower band of vocabulary, because
that's what "most likely next word" produces on average. Human writing is
lumpier — a three-word sentence next to a forty-word one.

⚠️ **The blind spot, which you have to name in Milestone 1.**

This signal cannot read. It has no idea what the text says. Anything that
changes the shape without changing the substance moves it — adding typos,
breaking up sentences, pasting in a quotation. That is a very cheap thing for
someone to do on purpose, and unit 8's attack set will do it to you.

Build each function on its own and call it from a terminal before you wire
anything together:

    """
    How much sentence length varies. ← TODO

    Returns:
        A float. Decide yourself what scale it's on and which direction means
        "more human" — then write that down, because your combining rule
        depends on knowing it.

    A hint on what you're reaching for: the standard deviation of sentence
    lengths, probably divided by the mean so a long text and a short one are
    comparable. `statistics.stdev` is imported for you.

    Watch the edge case: a one-sentence submission has no spread at all, and
    `stdev` raises on fewer than two values. Decide what that should return
    before the attack set decides for you.

    Mine: standard deviation of words-per-sentence divided by the mean (the
    coefficient of variation). 0 means every sentence is the same length;
    higher means more uneven, which reads as more human. Fewer than two
    sentences returns None — there's no spread to measure, and 0.0 would
    wrongly say "perfectly even".

def type_token_ratio(text: str) -> float:
    """
    Unique words over total words. ← TODO

    Returns:
        A float between 0 and 1. Higher means more varied vocabulary.

    Worth knowing before you rely on it: this measure falls as text gets
    longer, because common words repeat. Two texts of different lengths aren't
    directly comparable on it, and if your test inputs vary a lot in length,
    that alone can look like a signal.

    Mine handles that by averaging the ratio over every 50-word window
    (a moving-average type-token ratio), so a long text and a short one are
    measured on the same footing. Under 50 words it falls back to the plain
    ratio over the whole text.

def punctuation_density(text: str) -> float:

    How much punctuation, relative to length. ← TODO

    Returns:
        A float. Whether you count all punctuation or only some kinds — commas,
        semicolons, dashes — is a real choice. Semicolons and em dashes are
        more interesting than full stops, because they vary more between
        writers.

    Mine counts everything except full stops — commas, semicolons, colons,
    dashes, brackets, quotes, question and exclamation marks, ellipses — per
    word. Full stops are left out because every sentence has one, so they say
    more about sentence count than about style. Higher reads as more human.

# ── Combining them ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

def style_signal(text: str) -> float:
    """
    The style signal as a 0–1 score. **Higher means more likely AI.** ← TODO

    Combine your three measures into one number. Same direction as
    `detector.model_signal`, so that `scoring.combine_signals` can treat them
    the same way — if one of your signals runs backwards, everything above it
    is wrong in a way that's hard to see.

    Two things to decide and write down:

      1. Which direction each measure points. Low spread means more AI-ish, so
         it needs flipping. Work out which of your three need that.
      2. How to get each onto a comparable scale. A raw type-token ratio sits
         between 0 and 1; a raw punctuation count doesn't. Adding them
         unscaled means whichever has the bigger numbers wins by default.

    Test it on the four calibration inputs from Milestone 4 — clearly AI,
    clearly human, plain conventional human writing, lightly-edited AI — before
    you trust it. Plain and ordinary, not formal: formal prose reads as *human*
    to signal one, and it is plain writing that gets accused.

    Mine: each measure is mapped onto 0–1 with a straight ramp between a value
    that looks clearly AI (→ 1.0) and one that looks clearly human (→ 0.0),
    then the three are averaged with weights. All three run "higher = more
    human" raw, so every ramp flips them. The anchor values come from running
    my sample texts; spread separated them best, punctuation worst (casual
    human writing barely uses any), so the weights follow that.
